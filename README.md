## Running Your Code

You can run this using MAMP or you can use the local Laravel web server by doing ```php artisan serve```

Note: MySQL is still running through MAMP at this point.

## Branches

For each day I will simply create a branch with the commit at that particular point. If you want to see the code from that day just change to the appropriately-dated branch to review or download.
